# CashMoney
This is a Chrome extension which turns appearances of the word "cash" or "money" (case-insensitive) into "cash money," with appropriate casing preserved in most cases.

There is really no purpose to this project other than for laughs.

At the moment, this extension can be found and downloaded from the [Chrome Web Store here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cashmoney/kdholoifkiiodhpjmogbolahmnjmhlei).
